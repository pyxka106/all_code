One of the genetic risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS) is well known as HLA class II alleles, but the genetic association with human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire remain poorly understood. Here we investigated monozygotic twin discordant for MS with multi- validation cohorts to dissect how HLA genotype and disease status shape TCRβ composition at different aspects -- including clonal diversity, similarity, V-gene uage frequencies, CDR3 sequence composition, biochemical properties, and potential epitope recognition. We found that HLA background exerts minimal influence on overall diversity, but strongly constrains Vβ gene usage in an allele-specific manner. MS–healthy twin pairs shared the most TCRβ sequences, though shared sequences represented <5% of the total repertoire, indicating that the TCR repertoire from identical stem cells is still hypervariable despite identical genetic and environmental backgrounds. MS-associated TCRβ sequence patterns were identified in HLA-DRB1*15-positive individuals and validated in independent cohorts.
Within the TRBV19*01/TRBJ02-01*01 subset, we observed a robust and reproducible CDR3β signature characterized by aspartic acid (D) at position 6 and arginine (R) at position 7, respectively. With biochemical properties and DBSCAN clustering we also defined DRSS as a distinct motif pattern enriched in HD. GLIPH analysis independently confirmed preferential DRSS motif occurrence in healthy donors.
To explore potential antigen specification, AlphaFold structural modeling was applied to viral epitopes. A single EBV-derived peptide showed consistently higher predicted binding to DRSS-bearing TCRs, whereas no viral epitopes preferentially bound MS-associated sequences. Together, these findings identify complementary MS- and HD-associated TCRβ signatures that likely reflect distinct immunological histories and HLA-driven selection pressures.
